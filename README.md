# One Month Projects
There is a basic format you will want to use for your One-Month Projects. First thing you will want to do is fork the repository onto your own account so that you have the ability to edit our website. Next you will want to setup the proper file structure for your website. To see how this will work, take a look at members/nathansolomon.<br>

You will need to create a folder with your full name inside the members folder. Inside that folder, you are free to do whatever you want, however we have a few recommendations for you.
 - Make your home page for your site named `index.html` (this is standard website practice)
 - Create a `CSS` folder for your style sheets
 - Create `Asset folder(s)` for any images or other resources your site uses (on the example this is the images folder).
 - Create a `JS` folder<br>

When you are done working on your site, you can submit by creating a pull request to the Beta branch of this repository. Pull requests will need to be approved by four admins before we can add it to the site.
